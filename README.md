MaximaPool
==========

Pooling solution for starting up maxima processes so that
[moodle-qtype_stack](https://github.com/sangwinc/moodle-qtype_stack/) does not
need to wait for them, this may save over 250ms each time you have to call maxima.

## Basic overview

Stack being PHP-application it has no way of handling pooling of maxima processes
(i.e. no threads), maximapool is a Java-servlet doing just that and only that.

MaximaPool does not check what it inputs to the processes it is running nor does
it really care what it is running so you may also use it for other programs but most importantly you MUST MAKE SURE IT IS SECURED no public access and so on.


## How it works

Servlet keeps a set of processes running and uses them to evaluate commands it
receives as requests, the servlet responds by outputting the output of the process
one may define a timeout for the evaluation of the commands and in the case the
servlet returns whatever the process has outputted at that point (should the
timeout be reached the response code will be 416 otherwise the normal code 200
is used). The size of the pool kept may adapt to the frequency of the requests
and the frequency can be throthled.

Processes have a lifetime and once that is up they will be ended and new ones
started should the pool require new ones.

The main load caused by the servlet is due to the frequent updating of the
frequency estimate and simultaneous checking for old processes, this load may
be tuned by changing the frequency of these updates but that may cause problems
with demand spikes.

The servlet has a monitoring interface that shows some information about the
current state and allows direct test inputs. To access the monitoring interface
just make a GET-request for the servlet.


## Installation

Get [tomcat6](http://tomcat.apache.org/) or some other servlet-container
supportting Java 1.6.

Get [maxima](http://maxima.sourceforge.net/) it is needed for Stack.

Get [ant](http://ant.apache.org/) to build the servlet.

Start by installing Stack as normal and make sure that it works with the maxima
you have installed.

Download or clone the MaximaPool files somewhere. Copy maximapool-example.conf
to maximapool.conf and edit it have the correct configuration for your server.
Once the configuration matches the needs of your server, run ant to build the servlet.

Once the servlet has been built deploy the MaximaPool.war file to your
servlet-container, with tomcat just copy it to the webapps-directory.

With Stack check that tomcat or whatever user is running the servlet-container
and thus maxima has the correct permissions to write to Stacks work directorys.
Otherwise plots cannot be generated. Or setup the servlet in remote operating
mode so that it can transmit possible plots in the responses.

Open localhost:8080/MaximaPool/MaximaPool or whatever url you have configured
and test the servlet by inputting something.

Change Stack to use MaximaPool and set the maxima-command in Stack to match
the url where the servlet is running. Or use the Server mode with if you cannot
setup the system so that it would write plots to the correct place.

You may wish to clear the caches to check that the servlet actually works
otherwise you may just get old values from cache instead of new ones from the servlet.
